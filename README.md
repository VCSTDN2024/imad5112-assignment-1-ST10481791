## My Thoughts on This App

So, I built this app because my friend Hera was having a tough time deciding what to eat. She wanted something simple, something that could just tell her what to eat based on the time of day. I thought, "Why not make an Android app that does just that?"

Using Android Studio, I put together a quick app that suggests a meal when you enter the time of day. Nothing fancy, just a simple and fun way to get a meal suggestion without overthinking it.

## Features

- **Enter Time of Day** → Get a meal suggestion instantly.
- **Uses 'When' Statements** → Simple logic to decide meals.
- **User-Friendly UI** → Made with XML for a clean layout.

## Challenges I Faced

- **Using a Dropdown Instead of Input Text:** Initially, I thought about using an EditText field where users could type the time. But I realized that it would be too easy for users to enter invalid times or text by mistake.
  - **Solution:** I switched to a dropdown (Spinner) to limit choices to valid time slots, making the app more user-friendly and error-proof.
- **Choosing Between 'If' and 'When':** I wasn’t sure which to use at first.
  - **Solution:** After reading Kotlin docs, I went with 'when' since it's cleaner for multiple conditions.

## What I’d Like to Improve

This app is just a starting point, and I have ideas for making it better:

- **Better UI** → Maybe add some icons and animations.
- **More Meal Choices** → Different meals for different preferences.
- **Voice Input** → Say a time instead of typing it.

## AI & Tools I Used

I got a little help from AI for:

- **Fixing minor syntax errors** Fixed a few error codes I had because I left an empty space in my xml code.

Tools used: **ChatGPT, GitHub
